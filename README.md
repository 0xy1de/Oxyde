## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This is **not Windows**.  
Oxyde RT is an **independent project** designed to **recreate the aesthetics and nostalgia** of early 2000s desktops, powered by modern Linux foundations. The choice of C/C++ reflects the retro coding style used in XP-era software, not an attempt at direct compatibility.
